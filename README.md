Overview of what has been done:
1) Exploring skewness and outliers in the dataset.
2) Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.
3) ML Regression model which predicts continuous variable â€˜Selling_Price'.    
4) ML Classification model which predicts Status: WON or LOST.
5) Creating a streamlit page where you can insert each column value and you will get the Selling_Price predicted value or Status(Won/Lost).
